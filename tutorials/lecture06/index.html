				welcome to bootstrap responsive layout grid syste
				This book is designed to be both versatile and complete. You will find it useful for a variety
				of courses, from an undergraduate course in data structures up through a graduate course in
				algorithms. Because we have provided considerably more material than can fit in a typical
				one-term course, you should think of the book as a "buffet" or "smorgasbord" from which you
				can pick and choose the material that best supports the course you wish to teach.
				You should find it easy to organize your course around just the chapters you need. We have
				made chapters relatively self-contained, so that you need not worry about an unexpected and
				unnecessary dependence of one chapter on another. Each chapter presents the easier material
				first and the more difficult material later, with section boundaries marking natural stopping
				points. In an undergraduate course, you might use only the earlier sections from a chapter; in
				a graduate course, you might cover the entire chapter
